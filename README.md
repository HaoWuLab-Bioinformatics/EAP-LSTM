## Overview
The folder "**utils**" contains some essential utility functions.  
The file "**network.py**" is the code of the network architecture.  
The file "**main_drosophila.py**" is the code of the entire model to predict enhancer activity in Drosophila.   
The file "**main_human.py**" is the code of the entire model to predict enhancer activity in  human cell lines.
